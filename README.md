GPP and FF mini-apps from Berkeley GW application suite.
Complex number data type from CustomComplex class. 


Master branch uses CustomComplex class to represent a complex number. This is templated class which allows you to choose the data type to represent the real and imaginary parts of the complex number. 

CUDA branch uses GPUComplex, a modified version of CustomClass which inherits from the double2 vector type provided by CUDA framework.
